A README file exists in each of the folders with models

- [Seasonal Inventory](https://github.com/wpbSabi/python_optimization/tree/main/seasonal_inventory) is a multi-period inventory model with capacity constraints. The model utilizes ortools pywraplp.
- [Facility Location](https://github.com/wpbSabi/python_optimization/tree/main/facility_location) is a simple supply chain example combining optimization with geospatial visualization of the results.
- [Minimum Cost Flow](https://github.com/wpbSabi/python_optimization/tree/main/minimum_cost_flow) is a supply chain model that chooses the optimal transportation lanes.
- [Oregon Districts](https://github.com/wpbSabi/python_optimization/tree/main/oregon_districts) was a project in anticipation of 2020 Census data.  The project uses python optimization that is explained with an accompanying [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-draw-congressional-districts-in-python-with-linear-programming-b1e33c80bc52).
