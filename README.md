A README file exists in each of the folders with models

- Seasonal Inventory is a multi-period inventory model with capacity constraints. The model utilizes ortools pywraplp.
- Facility Location is a simple supply chain example combining optimization with geospatial visualization of the results.
- Minimum Cost Flow is a supply chain model that chooses the optimal transportation lanes.
- Oregon Districts was a project in anticipation of 2020 Census data. The project uses python optimization that is explained with an accompanying article.
