The models are written in python using jupyter notebook.  At the top of the python code is the import for the libraries, which you may need to install if you haven't already.

Utilize a jupyter notebook to open the ".ipynb" file. There are more details inside the notebook about the formulation, assumptions, and future model enhancements planned.
