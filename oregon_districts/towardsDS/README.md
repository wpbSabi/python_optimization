# Oregon Congressional Districting based on the 2020 Census

*-Updates will be made after the 2020 Census is released.  The model is currently based on population estimates*

This README is intended to accompany the [Towards Data Science article](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-draw-congressional-districts-in-python-with-linear-programming-b1e33c80bc52).  The jupyter notebook *Gists_Model_Follow_Along.ipynb* contains the same gists with only a little bit extra that was not shared in the article due to space.

For any future updates to the model, or to view a commented notebook or README, please move up to the parent directory, oregon_districts.
